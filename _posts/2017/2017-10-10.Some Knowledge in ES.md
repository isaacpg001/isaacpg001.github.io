##### $\Gamma$ function 
1. If $x ~ \Gamma(k_1,\theta)$ and $Y~\Gamma(k_2,\theta)$, then  $X+Y~ \Gamma(k_1+k_2,\theta)$.
2. As $\alpha =1 $, $\Gamma(1,\beta)$ is expotential distribution. Therefore for any other integer $\alpha$, we could generate $\alpha$ expotetial random variable to let their summation stand for a new random variable, which would be a generating method of $\Gamma$-random samples.


##### Accpet/Reject Algorithm

The question is how to generate a random sample with expected distribution, given that you already have some random generations with some sepecified distribution.

Suppose we generate two independent variables with $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$, and the cumulative distribution is $F_X(x)$ and $F_Y(y)$.

Let's see the following process:

1. Generate a x and y
2. If y<r(x), then go to process 1, otherwise choose x as a sample

Now we need to figure out what kind of distribution of this generated sample. Easy to know the probability desity  function is like

$$ \rho(x) ~ f_X(x) \int_{-\infty}^{r(x)} f_Y(y) dy$$


##### Sufficiency Principle

$X$ 是size为n的一个样本。 $T(x)$ 是样本计算出的一个变量，当然也是一个随机变量。
